## **Description**

Harmlessly is a **progressive web app** that focuses on **reducing the harm done by consuming substances** such as MDMA. This app allows users to **log what, when, how much and how they felt**. The app then based on this information provides the user with a lot of useful information such as what they **should expect to feel**, if the dose they did was **safe** or not among other things.

The app also has a **built-in wikipedia** with in-depth information about each substance that we have on the app. There's also gonna be a **premium mode** where the user will have access to chat with a **motivational chatbot** that could save many lifes by helping the users to **think positively**.

One other feature that is planned is the ability to **create groups** (with your friends) so that everyone is aware of what each other is taking during a night out. If someone suffers some kind of problem from the susbtances their friends will have easy access numbers for **emergency contacts** on the app and they will be able to know exactly what their friends took so that the **paramedics can be ready to assist immediately**.

Right now the app is only ready to be displayed on mobile phones (and it's not yet responsible to all of them, it's still **in progress**).
